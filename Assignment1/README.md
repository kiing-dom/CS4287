1. Objectives
• To build a “traditional” Machine Learning (ML) pipeline using a “traditional” MuiltLayer
Perceptron (MLP) for classification.
• Explore the impact of varying hyperparameter(s).
2. Submission
Submit a pdf describing
1. The Data Set (2 marks)
a. Visualisation of some of the key attributes is necessary for a top grade
b. Any pre-processing such as normalisation applied to the data
2. The network structure and other hyperparameters (2 marks).
3. The Cost / Loss / Error / Objective function (1 mark).
4. The optimiser (1 mark).
5. Cross Fold Validation (2 marks).
6. Results – accuracy and/or precision and/or recall (2 marks).
a. Include plots if opting for a top grade.
7. Evaluation of the results (2 marks).
8. Impact of varying a hyperparameter(s) (3 marks).
Submit a Jupyter notebook with the code where:
• The book is named CS4287-Prj1-ID1-ID2
o Where ID1 and ID2 are the student id numbers of the team members
Page 2
• The first line in the book is a comment with names and ID numbers of the team members
• The second line in the book should be a comment stating if the code executes to the end without
an error.
• The third line in the book should be a comment with a link to the original source where you
opted to reuse an existing implementation.
• Every critical line of code MUST be commented by YOU. To demonstrate a deep
understanding of that code.
